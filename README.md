# Doctor-Scraper-MAIIA

This project scrapes doctor profile data from the **MAIIA** platform to build a structured database.The goal of this project is to collect and consolidate as much publicly available information as possible in order to enrich a dataset with detailed profiles of healthcare practitioners.

### Concepts Used:

1. General DataFrame Manipulation ,  The pandas library was used for handling and transforming structured data in the form of DataFrames. Common operations included reading data from CSV files, filtering rows and columns, cleaning data, and performing aggregations or transformations to prepare it for further processing.
2. BeautifulSoup to Extract Unique URLs of Doctor Profile Pages BeautifulSoup is a Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents. It was used here to extract all unique URLs that point to individual doctor profile pages. This step was essential to identify the specific pages that needed to be scraped for detailed information.
3. User Agents to Optimize Web Scraping A user agent is a string sent by browsers (or bots) in HTTP requests to identify themselves to the web server. Many websites block or restrict automated scraping tools. By setting a custom user agent that mimics a real browser (e.g., Chrome or Firefox), the scraping script can avoid detection and improve access to the site.
4. Selenium for Scraping JavaScript-Rendered Pages Unlike BeautifulSoup, which only reads static HTML, Selenium is a web automation tool that controls a real browser. It allows scraping of dynamic content generated by JavaScript — for example, information that only appears after page load or user interaction (like clicking a button). Selenium was used to handle such cases where data was not immediately available in the initial HTML source.


### Results
Output: A structured database with a doctors table containing:
* Full name
* Address
* Medical specialty
* consultation availability

 ### Lessons Learned
* Scalability: To ensure efficient and reliable scraping, the process was broken down into manageable steps:
    * Data is saved regularly to prevent loss.
    * Requests are spaced out to imitate human browsing behavior.
